This calculator was originally made to build my huohuo for as much speed as possible while seeing how much healing i lose for swapping out substats, but as time went on i got bored and just added more healers and now you can simply input your HP/ATK, LC, Skill level and you can precisely see the healing output! so its a healing calculator i guess.
ToDo(maybe when im motivated):
1) Make it so that all the characters arent bound to if-else statements and are their own individual function
2) make a light discord bot version of this
3) maybe make a gui
